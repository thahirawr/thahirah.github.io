## Key Tasks and Implementation

### Task 1: Analyzing Flight Delays
- **Objective:** Count delayed flight mentions using Apache Spark and AWS EMR.
- **Data Flow:**
  - Input: Raw data from 10 Excel files cleaned into a single CSV.
  - Processing: PySpark filters and counts delay mentions.
  - Output: Results stored in Amazon S3.

---

### Task 2: Identifying Top Negative Feedback
- **Objective:** Analyze the top 5 negative feedback reasons for each airline.
- **Data Flow:**
  - Input: Raw data uploaded to S3.
  - Processing: Spark processes data for top complaint reasons.
  - Output: Results saved in CSV format to S3.

---

### Task 3: Country-Wise Complaints Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify the country with the most airline complaints using Hadoop MapReduce.
- **Data Flow:**
  - Input: ISO-3166 Alpha-3 codes and cleaned data.
  - Processing: Map-side join and sorting to identify complaints by country.
  - Output: Results sorted in descending order.

### Advanced Features: Integration with AWS RDS
- **Description:** Outputs from Task 6 are stored in a MySQL RDS database for scalability and reliability.
- **Benefits:** Persistent cloud storage ensures easy access and efficient querying.

---

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Debugging on EMR:** Limited visibility was mitigated using Jupyter Notebooks for local testing.
- **Dataset Issues:** Cleaning and filtering were essential for maintaining data integrity.
- **Visualization Dependencies:** Installing required libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn resolved plotting issues on AWS.

---

## Results and Insights
- **Most Common Complaints:** Flight delays, lost baggage, and poor service.
- **Geographic Trends:** The U.S. had the highest volume of complaints.
- **Visualization:** Heatmaps and bar charts provided actionable insights for airlines.
